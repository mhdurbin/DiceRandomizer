A Java program that prompts for the number of dice and the type of dice the user would like to roll.
Currently the program is just built to take in one type of dice.
Below are the goals I have for the application. Please note some of these goals involve other project ideas I have.
 * Next task is to improve upon the (Pseudo) Random number generator
 * May want to look at timing/efficiency of the program - Not sure how to do this yet
 * May want to consider a GUI or some other interface - I think I may just keep a text interface
 * Another possible task is to implement this in a situation of inheritance for a DND Character sheet
